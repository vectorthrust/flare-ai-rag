Categories (in order of precedence):
1. RAG_ROUTER
   • Use when input is a question about Flare Networks or blockchains related aspects
   • Queries specifically request information about the Flare Networks or blockchains
   • Keywords: blockchain, Flare, oracle, crypto, smart contract, staking, consensus,
   gas, node


2. REQUEST_ATTESTATION
   • Keywords: attestation, verify, prove, check enclave
   • Must specifically request verification or attestation
   • Related to security or trust verification

3. CONVERSATIONAL (default)
   • Use when input doesn't clearly match above categories
   • General questions, greetings, or unclear requests
   • Any ambiguous or multi-category inputs

Input: ${user_input}

Analyze the query provided and classify it into EXACTLY ONE category from the following
options:

    1. ANSWER: Use this if the query is clear, specific, and can be answered with
    factual information. Relevant queries must have at least some vague link to
    the Flare Network blockchain.
    2. CLARIFY: Use this if the query is ambiguous, vague, or needs additional context.
    3. REJECT: Use this if the query is inappropriate, harmful, or completely
    out of scope. Reject the query if it is not related at all to the Flare Network
    or not related to blockchains.

Input: ${user_input}

Response format:
{
  "classification": "<UPPERCASE_CATEGORY>"
}

Processing rules:
- The response should be exactly one of the three categories
- DO NOT infer missing values
- Normalize response to uppercase

Examples:
- "What is Flare's block time?" → {"category": "ANSWER"}
- "How do you stake on Flare?" → {"category": "ANSWER"}
- "How is the weather today?" → {"category": "REJECT"}
- "What is the average block time?" - No specific chain is mentioned.
   → {"category": "CLARIFY"}
- "How secure is it?" → {"category": "CLARIFY"}
- "Tell me about Flare." → {"category": "CLARIFY"}
